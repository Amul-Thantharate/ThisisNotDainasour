# This Is Not A Dinosaur
_Jurassic or Just-a-pic? Let our Dino-Detective decide!_

## What's this?!
It's more than just an app—it's a glimpse into the prehistoric world, a journey through pixels and patterns to uncover the ancient giants that once roamed the Earth. In simple words, this app accepts an image from the user and detects if any Dinosaurs are present in that image.

## But why!
For fun...and a bit more. I am a Machine Learning Engineer with 2 years of work experience. However, off late my search for a job has not proved to be quite fruitful. Doubts started creeping in and I started to question my ability as a coder, and I shied away from publishing any of the apps that I had created lately. This project is my attempt to break free from that self-doubt and to get back to doing what I love—coding!

## Tech Stack
- Python
- Streamlit
- Gemini Vision Pro
- Docker
- AWS ECS 
- Nginx

## How to use this app?
1. Upload an image
2. Click on the 'Detect' button
3. Wait for the app to process the image
4. Synk Code test

## How does it work?
The app uses a pre-trained model to detect the presence of Dinosaurs in the image. The model has been trained on a dataset of images containing Dinosaurs and other objects. The app uses the model to predict the presence of Dinosaurs in the uploaded image.
